# 1.	Background

The original visualization is created from the data provided by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government. The data is available under the sub-section of [Open Data Covid-19 DKI Jakarta Province.](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/)

**Context**

To support the news write-up of the latest development in DKI Jakarta with respect to Covid - 19 through two visual graphics. 


# 2.	Critiques and suggestions for the original visualization
## 2.1 Clarity
S/N |Critiques|Comments / Suggestions
----|-------------------------------|------------------------
1. |**Type of graph not appropriate** – The two charts are attempting to visualize uncertainty, dot plots and bar charts and not best graphs for such representations. | Two most commonly used approaches to visualize uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. 
2. |**Missing information on Confidence Interval and Margin of Error** – The graphs is trying to convey data using the statistical approach. However, no information on the level of confidence interval and margin of error is mentioned anywhere in the graph. | The graphs should give a complete picture of the data being represented.
3. |**Losing a lot of information from the data** – The dataset contains a lot of data points pertaining to Covid up-to a sub-district level, but such information is not highlighted in the present graphs. | The graphical representation should give a clear and truthful presentation of data.
4. |**Graph title not in sync with the chart** – The tittle of the first graph is “Top five districts with the highest number…”, but the visualization captures the data of all the districts of DKI Jakarta. | The graph must have a proper title which sets the true context of the visualization.
5. |**Source of the data not mentioned** | The graph should state the source of the data for authenticity and clarity.

## 2.2 Aesthetics
S/N	|Critiques |Comments / Suggestions | Image
----|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------
1. |**Annotations overlap data points** – The placement of the text annotation used to identify top 5 districts is done in such a way that it overlaps the data points, which makes it difficult to interpret the graph. | Annotations if used in graphs should be properly aligned to avoid overlapping.| ![](images/text annotation.png){width=70%}
2. |**Y Axis labels of the first graph are not legible** – All the districts has been mapped in this graph, but the orientation and the size makes it difficult to read and use the visualization. | The size of the labels and its placement should enhance the usability of the graph. | ![](images/Y Axis.png){width=50%}
3. |**Y Axis title of the first graph is incomplete** | Axis titles should be appropriately aligned and placed at the centre of the axis. This creates visibility and eliminates any ambiguity in interpretation.
4. |**No tick marks in the X Axis**  – There are no tick marks in-spite of representing continuous data in both the visuals.| In case of continuous data, tick marks makes the graph easy and quick to comprehend.

# 3.	Alternate Graphical Presentation
## 3.1 Proposed Design
The rough draft of proposed graphical presentation of the dataset is given below:

![](images/sketch.jpg)

## 3.2 Advantages of the design
S/N	| Aspect |	Issue | Action Taken
-----|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------
1. |Clarity | Choice of graph | Error plots used to visualize uncertainty
2. |Clarity | Missing information on Confidence Interval and Margin of Error | Tooltips appropriately mention the information for better interpretation
3. |Clarity | Losing a lot of information from the data | The two visualizations are interactive which gives information on all the status given in the dataset
4. |Clarity | Graph title not in sync with the chart | Appropriately modified
5. |Clarity | Source of the data not mentioned | Source mentioned and data link provided
6. |Aesthetic | Annotations overlap data points | No issue in the revised visuals
7. |Aesthetic | Y Axis labels of the first graph are not legible | Size adjusted accordingly to increase visibility
8. |Aesthetic | Y Axis title of the first graph is incomplete | Modified and resolved in the new visual
9. |Aesthetic | No tick marks in X Axis | Tick marks included in for better interpretation of the data

## 5.3.	Designing the Dashboard

1. Use the Dashboard tab, drag the two sheets – ‘City’ and ‘District’ to the dashboard space.
2.	Use ‘Text’ under ‘Objects’ to give appropriate title, add source, author and notes relevant to the graphs.
3.	Now the ‘City’ chart has to be linked to the 'District' graph in such a way, that upon selecting the plot of the city, the district graphs only display the error plots of selected city only. For this click on the city graph and select the filter icon that gets displayed on the upper right hand corner of the chart.
4.	Next under the ‘Dashboard’ tab select ‘Actions’. Then edit the filter options as shown in the screenshot below:

![](images/Action filter.png){width=40%}


The Dashboard is ready for analysis!
