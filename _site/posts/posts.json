The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Background\r\nThe original visualization is created from the data provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). Context\r\nTo show the volume of international trade over a period of two years from 2019-2020 for six economies of the world namely - Mainland China, US, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan.\r\n2. Critiques and suggestions for the original visualization\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments / Suggestions\r\n1\r\nGraph Title - The title of the graph mentions ‘Top Six Trading Countries, 2019-2020’ whereas in terms of combined value of export and import for a period of two years, Japan should be replaced by Indonesia to justify ‘top six’.\r\nThe title of the graph should not only be clear and concise but more importantly should be correct.\r\n2\r\nUse of different scale – The scale used to plot import and export data, especially in case of Hong Kong is not uniform. Export is in terms of millions and Imports is in terms of thousands.\r\nThis practice leads to gross misinterpretation of the graph and makes the visualization practically redundant.\r\n3\r\nIncorrect axis title – The title of X Axis is ‘Month of Period’ whereas the X Axis label is that of the year. The title of the axis is not in sync with the labels.\r\nAll the titles and the labels of the axis should be in place.\r\n4\r\nData not comparable – A separate graph for each country makes the comparison across countries difficult and in-turn makes the graph less handy and useful.\r\nGraph should be designed keeping the key objective in mind.\r\n5\r\nCurrency of the data is not mentioned\r\nIncomplete information leads to assumptions and multiple interpretations.\r\n6\r\nGraph for Japan is misleading - While the title of X axis for all the countries shows a timeline for two years, in case of Japan it shows only 2020.\r\nThere should be uniformity in the graph, otherwise it may lead to incorrect interpretation and defeat the purpose of visualization.\r\n7\r\nSource of the data not mentioned\r\nThe graph should state the source of the data for authenticity and clarity.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments / Suggestions\r\n1\r\nDifferent fonts – Three different fonts have been used in the graph for the Axis Title, Axis Label and Graph Title.\r\nThe text used in the graph should belong to the same font family. Moreover, the font should not be fancy and should be easy to read and understand.\r\n2\r\nMultiple axis for value – Two separate axis to represent export and import.\r\nThe use of two separate value axis makes the graph complicated, confusing, and clumsy. The graph should be clear and pleasing to the eye.\r\n3\r\nNo tick marks in the X and Y Axis – There are no tick marks in-spite of representing continuous data.\r\nIn case of continuous data, tick marks makes the graph easy and quick to comprehend.\r\n3. Alternate Graphical Presentation\r\n3.1 Proposed Design\r\nThe rough draft of proposed graphical presentation for the dataset is\r\n\r\n3.2 Advantages of the design\r\nS/N\r\nAspect\r\nIssue\r\nAction Taken\r\n1\r\nClarity\r\nGraph Title\r\nModified to ‘Major Players of International Trade’\r\n2\r\nClarity\r\nDifferent Scale in the same graph\r\nUniform scale for both Imports and Exports\r\n3\r\nClarity\r\nTitle of Y Axis\r\nRemoved as the X axis label depicts the timeline\r\n4\r\nClarity\r\nCross-country data comparison is difficult\r\nOne single graph with data of all the countries instead of six separate graphs\r\n5\r\nClarity\r\nCurrency not mentioned\r\nThe title of Y axis to highlight the currency\r\n6\r\nClarity\r\nGraph for Japan is misleading\r\nThe new graph resolves the issue\r\n7\r\nClarity\r\nSource of the data not mentioned\r\nSource mentioned and data link provided\r\n8\r\nAesthetic\r\nDifferent usage of fonts\r\nFormatting done to ensure uniformity\r\n9\r\nAesthetic\r\nDual axis for value\r\nOne axis to represent both import and export values\r\n10\r\nAesthetic\r\nNo tick marks in the X and Y Axis\r\nTick marks included in both the axis for better interpretation of the data\r\n4. Proposed Visualization\r\nThe remake of the given visualization can be accessed here\r\n5. Data Visualization Steps\r\n5.1 Data Preparation\r\nMS Excel has been used to prepare the data for the purpose of visualization. There are three sheets in the Excel Workbook –\r\nContent – Remove as not relevant to our work.\r\nT1 – Contains Import Data, rename to ‘Import Data’\r\nT2 – Contains Export Data, rename to ‘Export Data’. All the steps below has been applied to both ‘Import Data’ and ‘Export Data’ sheets.\r\nAs the time frame is Jan’19 - Dec’20 delete all the other columns of both the Import and Export data.\r\nClean the data further removing redundant rows from the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nAs the visualization is concerned with six countries namely – Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and US, filter the dataset accordingly to select and keep only these six countries. Remove the rest of the countries from the base file.\r\n\r\nMake the data presentable by deleting the suffix “(Thousand Dollars)” from the name of the countries. The final dataset looks as:\r\n\r\n5.2 Data Visualization\r\nImport the file is in Tableau.\r\n\r\nTo Pivot the data – select all the columns with the time period (Jan’19 – Dec’20). Right click and select “Pivot”.\r\n\r\nRename the headers – Rename ‘Variables’ to ‘Countries’, ‘Pivot Field Names’ to ‘Period’ and ‘Pivot Field Values’ to ‘Import’/’Export’\r\n\r\nChange Data Type of the ‘Period’ from ‘String’ to ‘Date’\r\n\r\nLink the two datasets – ‘Import Data’ and ‘Export Data’ by using the common fields of ‘Countries’ and ‘Period’\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Countries’ and ‘Period’ to Columns and ‘Measure Value’ to Rows\r\n\r\nExpand ‘Year(Period)’ tab to ‘Month(Period)’ and click on the tab to change the format to ‘Month’\r\n\r\nDrop ‘Measure Names’ to the ‘Color’ side panel to differentiate the Export and the Import values\r\n\r\nThis is how the base graph will look like\r\n\r\nThe title of Y Axis is relevant as the timeline is clearly shown. To remove the title, right click on the Y axis and select ‘Edit Axis’. Delete the title under ‘Axis Titles’\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, edit the title of the X Axis\r\n\r\nGive an appropriate title to the graph, change it to ‘Major Players of International Trade’\r\nChange the title of the legend from ‘Measure Names’ to ‘Type of Trade’\r\n\r\nFormat the title and label of the axis to ensure that there is similar font across.\r\nThe data on both the X and the Y Axis is ‘continuous’ in nature, hence both the axis is modified to incorporate ‘tick marks’ for easy and better interpretation. For this, right click on the axis and select ‘Edit Axis’.\r\n\r\nAdd a reference line (right click on the axis and select ‘Add reference line’) to show the average value trade of the six countries – this will make comparison easy.\r\n\r\nFormat the title with grey background and white text.\r\nMove the worksheet to the dashboard.\r\nUse ‘Text’ under ‘Objects’ to add ‘Source’ and ‘Author’.\r\n6. Key Observations\r\nThe impact of COVID – 19 is clearly evident in countries like Mainland China, Malaysia and United States. From the graph we can see that there is a dip in both exports and imports of these countries.\r\nWhile in five countries value of exports is dominated by the value of imports, or are at par, Hong Kong is a big exception. Hong Kong is primarily into exports. The value of imports made by Hong Kong comprises of around 10% of the value of exports. There is a wide gap (of approximately $5 million) in the exports and imports.\r\nTowards the second half of 2020, exports showed a significant improvement both in China and in US.\r\n7.
