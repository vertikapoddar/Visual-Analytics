The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\nR code\r\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\nRcode\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n#1. BACKGROUND The original visualization is created from the data provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). Context / Key takeaways - ?\r\n#2. Critiques and suggestions for the original visualization (table format) ##2.1 Clarity S/N CRITIQUES COMMENTS / SUGGETIONS 1. Graph Title – The title of the graph mentions the timeline as 2019-2020 which is ambiguous as the graph represents the data of two years. The title of the graph should be such as it gives 2. Use of different scale – Two different scale has been used to plot export and import data. This leads to misinterpretation and misrepresentation.\r\n3. Incorrect axis title – The title of X Axis is ‘Month of Period’ whereas the X Axis label is that of the year. The title of the axis is not in sync with the labels. 4. Data not comparable – A separate graph for each country makes the comparison across countries difficult and in-turn makes the graph less handy and useful.\r\n5. Currency not mentioned -\r\n6. Graph for Japan is misleading\r\n7. Source of the data not mentioned\r\n##2.2 Aesthetics S/N CRITIQUES COMMENTS / SUGGETIONS 1. Different fonts – Three different fonts have been used in the graph for the Axis Title, Axis Label and Graph Title. The text used in the graph should belong to the same font family. Moreover, the font should not be fancy and should be easy to read and understand. 2. Multiple axis for value – Two separate axis to represent export and import. The use of two separate value axis makes the graph complicated, confusing, and clumsy. The graph should be clear and pleasing to the eye. 3. No tick marks in the X and Y Axis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
